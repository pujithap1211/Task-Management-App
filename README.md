# Task-Management-App

The Task Management App is a dynamic and interactive web application that helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks through a clear and intuitive interface. Users can add tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level, and see them instantly displayed on the screen with options to edit, delete, or mark them as completed. Completed tasks are moved to a separate section and visually distinguished from pending ones. This application includes filtering options to view tasks by priority, due date, or status, helping users stay organized.
